Problem 4: Consider the following function:

public int func(int n) {
	if (n <= 1)
		return 1;
	else
		return func(n - 1) + func(n - 1) + func(n - 1);
}

(a) Give a recurrent relation for this function.

(b) Solve the recurrence relation using repeated substitution to get the big O of the running time.
