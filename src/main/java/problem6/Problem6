Problem 6
(a) Show the counter array (used in counting sort) for the following array of integers:
5, 8, 1, 9, 8, 1, 0, 4, 8, 3, 4, 6
Assume that each element is in the range from 0 to 9.

(b) Refer to the pdf. Consider the array of elements shown in Problem 6 in the pdf, and
assume the range of elements is from 0 to 14.
Use Bucket Sort to sort the array, using four buckets that represent the following ranges: 0-3, 4-7, 8-11 and 12-14.
Show the bucket array.
