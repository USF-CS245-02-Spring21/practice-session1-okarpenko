Problem 6
(a) Show the counter array (used in counting sort) for the following array of integers:
5, 8, 1, 9, 8, 1, 0, 4, 8, 3, 4, 6
Assume that each element is in the range from 0 to 9.

Solution:
Counter array: (indices go from 0 to 9)
[1, 3, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 8, 11, 12]

(b) Consider the following array of elements:
(3, Pablo), (4, Colin), (5, Julie), (1, Sean), (9, Leah), (12, Tom), (8, Xin), (7, Elsa)
Assume the range of elements is from 0 to 14.
Use Bucket Sort to sort the array, using four buckets that represent the following ranges: 0-3, 4-7, 8-11 and 12-14.
Show the bucket array.

Solution:
The  bucket array will have 4 elements.
The first element will point to the following linked list:
(1, Sean) - > (3, Pablo)
The second element will point to the following linked list:
(4, Colin)-> (5, Julie)->(7, Elsa)
The third element will point to the following linked list:
(8, Xin) -> (9, Leah)
The fourth element will point to the following linked list:
(12, Tom)

After iterating over the bucket array and putting everything back into arr, we get:
(1, Sean), (3, Pablo), (4, Colin), (5, Julie), (7, Elsa), (8, Xin),  (9, Leah),(12, Tom)
