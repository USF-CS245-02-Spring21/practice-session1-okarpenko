Problem 2:
(a) Show the following list after the first partition operation, using the last element as a pivot:
 9, 39, 3, 15, 17, 7, 29, 1, 10, 28, 21, 18

Your Answer:
First, we swap 39 and 10, then 29 and 1. Then i and j cross, and we swap the element at index i with 18, the pivot.
9 10 3 15 17 7 1 18 39 28 21 29


(b) Consider the following array:  1, 0, 13, 50, 22, 14
    If this is the result after the first partition, which of these elements could have been the pivot?
Your Answer:
13
Elements on the left are smaller than 13. Elements on the right are larger.
No other element could be the pivot in this example.
